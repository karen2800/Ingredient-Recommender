# Ingredient Recommender
Recommends ingredients to add to or remove from a recipe according to how well they belong. Can help determine which ingredients are missing from a recipe, or to help modify an existing recipe to a persons' needs or preferences.

This is based on my Ingredient Recommender System project (https://github.com/karen2800/Ingredient-Recommender-System). Some of the changes I made here is that now I have a greater number of recipes and unique ingredients since I expanded my dataset, whereas in my original project this was very limited. I also am only using my best performing model, normalized Naive Bayes, and have made it more user-friendly.
